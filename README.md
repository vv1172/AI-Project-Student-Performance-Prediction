# AI-Project-Student-Performance-Prediction
This project aims to predict student performance using artificial intelligence techniques. By analyzing various factors such as demographic information, socio-economic status, previous academic records, and personal characteristics, the system predicts the potential academic performance of students. This predictive model can be utilized by educational institutions to identify students who may require additional support and intervention, thereby enhancing student success rates and improving educational outcomes.
